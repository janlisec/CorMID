\usage{
CalcTheoreticalMDV(
  fml = NULL,
  nbio = NULL,
  nmz = NULL,
  algo = c("CorMID", "Rdisop")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fml}{The chemical formula of the compound.}

\item{nbio}{Provide the number of biological carbon within \code{fml} explicitly.}

\item{nmz}{Provide the number of measured isotopes of \code{fml} explicitly.}

\item{algo}{algo.}
}
\value{
A matrix of theoretical mass distribution vectors.
}
\description{
\code{CalcTheoreticalMDV} will compute the Mass Distribution Vectors
 of isotopologues as it is used for correction matrix in \link{CorMID} computations.
}
\details{
\code{CalcTheoreticalMDV} basically is a convenience function using Rdisop
 to generate the isotopologue distribution at natural abundance of \eqn{^{13}C}{13C}
 for a given formula.
 It will break this down into a matrix where the components of the MID constitute
 the rows and the expected relative ion intensities are within the columns.
 The number of exported ion intensities and MID components can be limited
 if numeric values for \code{nmz} and/or \code{nbio} are provided as parameters.
}
\examples{
# standard distribution matrix
fml <- "C5H6Si1"
CalcTheoreticalMDV(fml = fml)

# extend to more columns (number of measured ions) if required
CalcTheoreticalMDV(fml = fml, nmz = 4)

# limit to a smaller number of biological carbon (i.e. if compounds are silylated)
CalcTheoreticalMDV(fml = fml, nmz = 4, nbio = 2)
#CalcTheoreticalMDV(fml = fml, nmz = 4, nbio = 2, algo="Rdisop")

# from Vignette
fml <- "C21Si5"
round(CalcTheoreticalMDV(fml = fml, nbio = 21, nmz = 21)[-(5:19), -(5:19)], 4)
}
