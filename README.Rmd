**CorMID** is an R-package providing functions to solve problems during 
metabolic flux analysis using HR-APCI-MS.

In metabolic flux experiments tracer molecules (often glucose containing 
labelled carbon) are incorporated in compounds measured using mass spectrometry. 
The mass isotopologue distributions (MIDs) of these compounds needs to be 
corrected for natural abundance of labelled carbon and other effects, which are 
specific on the compound and ionization technique applied. This package provides 
functions to correct such effects in high resolution gas chromatography 
atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (GC-HR-APCI-MS) 
analyses.

## Installation

You can install the development version of CorMID from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("janlisec/CorMID")
```

or install the version from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CorMID) 
instead.

## Quick Example

**CorMID** is supposed to disentangle a complex MID. Complex means that the ion
intensities of the isotopes are influenced by natural abundance, artificial
labeling (e.g. by a <sup>13</sup>C-Glucose tracer) and mass spectrometry 
artifacts (i.e. several potential adducts/fragments).

You can create and visualize such a complex mass spectrum, *i.e.* a vector of 
measured ion intensities, by providing a *chemical formula*, the *true MID* and 
an *adduct distribution* like follows:

```{r exmpl1}
# a chemical formula, here: Lactic acid 2 TMS
fml <- "C9H22O3Si2"

# the true mass isotopologue distribution, here: 10% U13C enriched
mid <- c(0.9, 0, 0, 0.1)

# adduct distribution, here: 3 different APCI adducts are formed
r <- list("M+H" = 0.8, "M-H" = 0.1, "M+H2O-CH4" = 0.1)

# reconstruct the measured intensity vector
rMID <- CorMID::recMID(mid = mid, r = r, fml = fml)
round(rMID, 3)
```

**CorMID** provides a class specific plotting function for such a reconstructed 
MID:

```{r exmpl1_plot, fig.width=4, fig.height=3.5}
plot(rMID, ylim=c(0,0.6))
mtext(text = "Reconstructed MID", side = 3, line = -1.25, adj = 0.98, outer = T)
text(x = 3, y = 0.4, labels = "[M+H]+", pos=2)
```

Instead of labeling the mass spectrum with actual ion masses, **CorMID** unifies
the annotation for all molecules with respect to the largest adduct, in APCI
usually the [M+H]+, which is labeled as M+0. Other peaks are labeled indicating 
the approximate mass difference to [M+H]+ in Dalton as M+1, M+2, etc.

Assuming that you have measured the above intensities in your experiment, the main 
function of **CorMID** can estimate the underlying *MID* and *r* for you:

```{r exmpl2}
# disentangle the adduct ratios and true isotopologue distribution (enrichment) from the above test data
out <- CorMID::CorMID(int = rMID, fml = fml)
print(out)
```

Please note: no information regarding the true labeling status and the adduct 
distribution was provided in the above function call. **CorMID** is able to 
*guess* the most likely combination.

This allows you to perform the correction for natural abundance and technical 
artifacts in a single step and extract the relevant labeling status for flux
analysis or other statistical evaluations.

However, in a real world experiment it would be a smart strategy to process 
non-labeled control samples setting a fixed mid, *i.e.* c(1, 0, 0, 0) for
a molecule with 3 biological carbon atoms like lactic acid, to identify the
specific adducts *r* formed on your device for this molecule. In the next step
you can use this information to fix *r* while processing your labeled samples
which will improve the detection of the correct labeling status *MID*.

describing the package functions in detail or read the [publication](https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo12050408) 
which shows an evaluation of the performance of **CorMID** on several real data 
sets.
